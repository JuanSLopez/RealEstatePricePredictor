# Real Estate Price Predictor
This project encapsulates a semester worth long of Statistical Learning/ Machine Learning algorithms all put into a Regression type model for data analysis on Real Estate Data. My idea was to use and optimize the models for better Mean Squared Errors and testing them compared to other models. Some of the specific models I decided to look at were, Multinomial Regression with all, significant and polynomial attributes, Bagging with all, significant, and polynomial attributes, and Random Forests with all, significant, and polynomial regression. My analysis concluded that Random Forests was the best learning model that could give the least Mean Squared Error. These findings were very significant and importance
